Hi this is my 1st ever public project. This repository contains a deep learning model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the stock prices of a specific company (e.g., GS) based on historical data. The model is trained on historical stock price data and incorporates features such as the closing prices of the company’s stock and the S&P 500 index. It utilizes the TensorFlow framework for implementation and achieves predictions for both short-term and long-term periods. The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This project aims to demonstrate the application of LSTM networks in financial time series forecasting
